# The Odin Project Foundations Project 1 - Recipes
### Description and Purpose:
This repository contains the first project of The Odin Project's Foundations curriculum. The purpose of which is to demonstrate a working knowledge of HTML basics. The final product is a simple website with an index linking to three recipes. Personally, I found the idea of using normal, everyday recipes to be quite dull. So, I decided to have a little fun with this project and use recipes that are a bit more... peculiar.

Each recipe required appropriate headers for each section, an image, a multi-paragraph description, an unordered list of ingredients, and an ordered list of instructions. I went slightly further than stipulated in the project's requirements and included blockquotes, italic/bold text when appropriate, and a back button on each recipe to return to the index.

Another purpose of this project was to practice proper version control through using a git workflow with proper timing and notation of commits.

### Skills Demonstrated:
An understanding of the following html concepts and elements:
- General HTML boilerplate (DOCTYPE, charsets, head, body, etc)
- Headers (h1, h2, etc)
- Images (img elements with src, alt, and height/width attributes if necessary)
- Paragraphs
- Emphasis and Strong for italic and bold styling
- Linking using the anchor element
- Unordered and ordered lists

An understanding of git version control and proper notation using the following basic commands:
- git status
- git log
- git add
- git commit
- git push

### Conclusion:
I have some previous HTML experience from many, many years ago, and this project was a great refresher. It was quite enjoyable, has energized me to continue with The Odin Project's curriculum, and I'm looking forward to revisiting this project once I gain more experience with HTML and also once I dip my toes in CSS.
