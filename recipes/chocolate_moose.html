    <h3>Description:</h3>

      <p>I hope you can excuse the fact, dear reader, that the above image 
        is of a moose before preparation and not of the finished dish, 
        the delectable <strong>Chocolate Moose.</strong> Unfortunately 
        (or fortunately depending on who you ask), the final product's 
        aroma was so mouthwatering it caused a stampede amongst my guests.
      </p>

      <p>As our fellowship of feasters reached nigh <em>Dionysian</em> 
        levels of voracious frenzy, I found my camera with all the 
        "after" pictures being devoured by a young woman lost to the throes 
        of gluttonous passion. Frankly, I wasn't even sure she was invited to 
        dinner in the first place, and as I peered around the free-for-all, I 
        noticed the number of attendees had doubled (with more pouring through 
        the doors and windows every minute). The Chocolate Moose was soon gone down 
        the gullets of the banqueteers ... and so were about half to two-thirds 
        of my personal belongings 
      </p>

      <p>It was at this moment that I remembered my grandmother's old saying 
        about this recipe: "Never make Chocolate Moose, you dolt!"
      </p> 
        
      <p><em>C'est la vie...</em></p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>1 moose</li>
      <li>40 pounds of chocolate</li>
      <li>17 containers Cool Whip or equivalent</li>
      <li>1 cherry</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions:</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>Send spouse to the wilderness to capture moose or have one 
        delivered by UPS. Spouse can be substituted with any significant 
        other or equivalent person willing to do your bidding.
      </li>
      <li>Meanwhile, melt chocolate in very large double boiler. Keep warm.</li>
      <li>Tie up moose with rope.</li>
      <li>Holding the moose by the tail, carefully dip in melted chocolate, 
        covering it completely with a thin coating.
      </li>
      <li>Arrange moose attractively on large platter and refrigerate for 
        2 days to set chocolate.
      </li>
      <li>Remove rope, wash to remove chocolate (if necessary), and return 
        rope to clothesline.
      </li>
      <li>Garnish chocolate moose with Cool Whip and top with a cherry.</li>
      <li>Serve immediately.</li>
      <li>If adventurous, chew the rope. Some say it is tastier.</li>
      <li>May be doubled for serving a crowd.</li>
    </ol>
