    <h3>Description:</h3>
    
    <blockquote><em>"After two of those babies, the dullest, 
      most by-the-book Vogon will be up on the bar in stilettos, 
      yodeling mountain shanties and swearing he's the king of the 
      Gray Binding Fiefdoms of Saxaquine"</em></blockquote>

    <p>The <strong>Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster</strong> is 
      an alcoholic beverage invented by ex-President 
      of the Galaxy, Zaphod Beeblebrox. Considered the 
      <em>Best Drink in Existence</em>, the Pan Galactic 
      Gargle Blaster is said to have effects similar to 
      "having your brains smashed out by a slice of lemon 
      wrapped round a large gold brick."</p> 
    
    <p>Beeblebrox himself advised that you should "never drink 
      more than two Pan Galactic Gargle Blasters unless you are 
      a thirty ton mega elephant with bronchial pneumonia." (At 
      this time, it should be noted that the chronicler of this 
      recipe has <strong>excellent</strong> legal representation 
      should any reader pursue this concontion.)</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    
    <ul>
      <li>1 bottle Ol' Janx Spirit</li>
      <li>1 measure water from the seas of Santraginus V</li>
      <li>3 cubes Arcturan Mega-gin</li>
      <li>4 litres Fallian marsh gas</li>
      <li>1 measure Qualactin Hypermint extract</li>
      <li>1 tooth of an Algolian Suntiger</li>
      <li>1 olive</li>
      <li>Zamphour to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions:</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>Take the juice from the bottle of Ol' Janx Spirit and pour 
        into it the water from the seas of Santraginus V. - <em>Oh, 
        that Santraginean seawater! Oh, those Santraginean fish!</em>
      </li>
      <li>Allow the cubes of Arcturan Mega-gin to melt into the mixture 
        (it must be properly iced or the benzene is lost).
      </li>
      <li>Bubble the Fallian marsh gas through it in memory of all those 
        happy hikers who have died of pleasure in the Marshes of Fallia.
      </li>
      <li>Over the back of a silver spoon, float the Qualactin Hypermint 
        extract, redolent of all the heady odours of the dark Qualactin 
        Zones, subtle, sweet, and mystic.
      </li>
      <li>Drop in the tooth of an Algolian Suntiger. Watch it dissolve, 
        spreading the fires of the Algolian Suns deep into the heart 
        of the drink.
      </li>
      <li>Sprinkle Zamphour.</li>
      <li>Add an olive.</li>
      <li>Enjoy...very carefully.</li>
    </ol>
